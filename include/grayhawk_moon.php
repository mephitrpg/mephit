Though the vineyard's exact location is a mystery, the legend is widespread, and many grapegrowing regions claim that the Seven Sisters came from their lands. At night, therefore, the story is acted out and people head out to the grape arbours, listening for echoes of the sisters' laughter as they ascended to paradise. The rest of the holiday is a celebration of the grape and its byproducts and features prayers for a good vintage in the coming year, as well as much celebration and sampling of the previous year's wines. It is especially sacred to followers of the Laughing Rogue, though followers of other nature deities often officiate as well."

SEALORDS' FEAST celebrated in coastal areas, esp. \"Festival of the Blue Moon\" at midweek, when Celene is full. In Greyhawk and other inland areas, Guild Days are celebrated at this time instead.

Also known in some communities as the FEAST OF SOTILLION in celebration of the god's victory in wresting the sun from its southern decline and bringing it back to warm Oerth and promote growth and prosperity. Celebrants use the time to enjoy the leisures of summer with picnics and family reunions. It is a time to put aside family strife and offer reconciliation, in honor of the sun own homecoming.

MIDSUMMER DAY is consider the Holy Day of Pelor, god of sun, light, and healing. In most good or neutral places this is an official rest day, and the holiday is even respected in some evil lands like the Great Kingdom. Feasting and enjoying the sun are important activities, and it is considered a sign of respect to wear yellow somewhere on one's person. In non-evil lands, at least, those who don't are regarded with some suspicion. The weather tends to be uncannily reliable (rain is generally a sure sign of Pelor's extreme disfavour with an area), and public services are held outdoors by Pelor's priests. A public processional is followed by a free meal, and healing and comfort is provided to the needy while priests and priestesses vigorously entreat the more fortunate for alms.

All undead are turned at +4 during Midsummer's Day. Priests of Nerull also dread this day, as they suffer a -2 on all rolls and opponents get a +2 to save vs. their spells. The bonus against undead vanishes that night, but the priests of Nerull must lie low until the next night before their curse wears off.

Note that in the Theocracy of the Pale, this day is held to be sacred of Pholtus instead, though many of the same activities occur. Travelers are warned that celebrants all wear white instead, and yellow clothing or a yellow fabric strip pinned to one's tunic are considered blasphemous.

Both moons are full the 4th day of Richfest, on MIDSUMMER NIGHT. Lycanthropes aplently, but faeries are also extremely active and Mages also report certain spell enhancements now and again. This is often the evening when spell-shows happen.",

			"description"	=>	"Begins with 'MUMMERING.' People wear disguises and try to remain unrecognized, in order to celebrate the wondrous and strange effect that magic and magical creatures have in the world. Nevertheless, it should be noted that actual use of magic in such disguises is considered cheating, and is frowned on in most areas. There is dancing and general carousing, and the high point is a parade and the Performance of the Mummers, a play in which good and evil battle. Evil wins but the youngest speaking child resurrects good and removes the evil from the bad actor. It is rare but not unknown for some members of evil cults to take steps at this point, and vigilance is usually tight in larger cities.

One exception is The Empire of Iuz, which holds a variant play in which their evil lord fights good and wins. This is usually enacted by having priests in ceremonial masks publicly fight, defeat, and then sacrifice a lightlyarmed prisoner amidst general rejoicing.

The rest of the holiday is devoted to general merriment, and the last night before the months are again counted in the calendar is very special. This is the FEAST OF UNREASON, which is honoured by many diverse faiths (Boccob, Lydia, Lirr, Norebo, Olidammara, Ralishaz, Trithereon, and even Rao and Iuz!) for different reasons. In general, however, the mode of celebration is the same: Servants are promoted to the head of towns, villages, and even royal courts, where they preside over the feast's duration. They orchestrate silly laws {i.e.. having farmers push their carts, wearing only one shoe, etc.} which must be obeyed, though traditionally they are followed about by a 'true' authority who can overrule any proclamations deemed to be disastrous. Popular everywhere, even in the Great Kingdom, but ruthlessly suppressed in the Theocracy of the Pale. This is a very popular Greyhawk festival, where it is colloquially known as \"Zagyg's Feast.\" The Mad Archmage retains his distinction as the only actual ruler to ever be elected to preside at these festivals, and his influence can still be felt today. Mages report that their spells will occasionally misfire in odd and/or humorous ways during this period, though such misfires will never occur in lifethreatening situations unless one has greatly offended Zagyg or Boccob.

Needfest is also known in some places as the FEAST OF TELCHUR, this holiday honours Telchur's valiant battle in creating winter, and celebrates the beginning of winter's waning. In some places, an elaborate play commemorates this event (Great Kingdom). In others, remembrance of family and recital of the family tree is an important part of the day (Keoish principalities, Geoff, and Ulek). Most places, however, celebrate primarily with an open house dinner after dark, the giving of presents, chainlighting of candles, and singing and folk dancing. The goal is to make the sun feel like he is missing the fun so that he comes back before it gets too cold.",
